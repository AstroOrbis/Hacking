<h3>What is a hacker?</h3>


<h4>A computer hacker is a computer expert who utilizes their knowledge in technology to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle within a computerized system, by non-standard means.

The term itself, "hacker" has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker," which is someone who breaks into computer systems and accesses data otherwise unavailable to them.</h4>

<h3>Where does hacking come from? (A history of hacking)
</h3>

<h4>The term “hack” didn’t actually originate from computers; it came from MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club in 1961, when club members hacked their high-tech train sets in order to modify their functions. They changed from toy train sets to computers, though, and used the expensive IBM 704’s at MIT to explore new things they could do and new tasks they could accomplish.

The 1970s gave way to a new type of hacking; hacking phones. These hackers were named “phreakers,” like the famous John Draper. Fun fact, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were phreakers. 
The 1980s introduced personal computers to the general public, which unsurprisingly led to a rise of hackers. The amount of cyber criminals led to the first ever Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

<br>

In the 1990s, the number of hackers grew, the malicious hackers being called “crackers”. Lots of “crackers” were arrested, such as the notable Kevin Mitnick, Kevin Poulsen, Robert Morris and Vladimir Levin.

<br>

The years 2000 introduced newer and more dangerous types of hacking that victimized important government-related businesses, such as Microsoft, Ebay, Yahoo! and Amazon. The Department of Defense and International Space Station actually had its system breached by a 15 year old boy!

In the 2010s, lone hackers as well as small groups of hackers are hidden in every corner of the internet. Nowadays, hacking has become way more complex and sophisticated than it ever was. Government entities still desperately try to this day to make sure hackers can’t access their systems. There is also the rise of hacktivists groups, the most notable one being Anonymous.

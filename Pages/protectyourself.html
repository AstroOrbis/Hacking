<h1>Protect yourself</h1>

<h2>Precautionary measures to take in order to not get hacked!</h2>

<button class="accordion">Passwords</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Make sure your passwords are complex and long with both lowercase and uppercase letters, and include numbers. Avoid using auto-complete. 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WiFi</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Don’t access any important information, like your finances, or just anything personal on public WiFi. It’s best to do those things on a more secure connection.
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Viruses</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Install a security software, like an antivirus, or antimalware. Many are free, or have a free trial. For simple files, use VirusTotal. 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Updating</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Always keep your software up to date. Often, updates can include security enhancements.
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Alerts</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Sign up for account alerts; a lot of email providers and websites will notify you when your account is accessed from an unusual location. 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Connections</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Some seemingly innocent USB drives can actually execute malicious code on your computer. For example, the <a href="https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe">USB Rubber Ducky</a>, or the more recent <a href="https://shop.hak5.org/products/bash-bunny">Bash Bunny</a>. There is also a process called Juice Jacking, in which malicious code is uploaded to your phone when you start charging it. As a rule of thumb, don't plug anything suspicious into your computer/phone.
